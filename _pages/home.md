###### Research Assistant, Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica

I am a bio-physicist with main area of experience in image processing, optics and device automation. My current work focuses mainly on applying cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging methods to solve the structure of biological molecules and their distribution in 3D space.
