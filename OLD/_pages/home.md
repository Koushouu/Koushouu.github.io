## Cheng-Yu (Kou) Huang
#### Research Scientist, Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica

I am a bio-physicist with the main areas of experience in image processing, optics and device automation. My current work focuses mainly on applying cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging methods to solve the structure of biological molecules and their distribution in 3D space. Apart from science, I read, write, cook and make art sometimes.
