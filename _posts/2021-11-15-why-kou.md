My name in Mandarin is Huang Cheng-Yu (黃承宇） and Huang in Japanese is Ko-U. 
Since most English speakers can not pronounce Huang or Cheng-Yu correctly I tell them to call me Kou, easier for them and for me too.

But the drawback is that when people see "Kou" they thought it's pronounced "Cow", and people misspell my name often as Koh.
And I know quite many people who either know me as Kou only or Cheng-Yu only, they thought they are different people.
Anyway I cannot blame anyone for this

To avoid confusion I put "Cheng-Yu (Kou)" at the end of almost all my official emails
